# Decision-Tree
Decision Tree Classifier model made from scratch. Built with the intention of gaining a more conceptual understanding of this fundamental ML model. 
The Regressor counterpart will be in the works as soon as I finish the Classifier.

# Future goals for this repo:
- See if I can get this to work on the Polars library instead of Pandas for better performance.
- Try to construct my own ensemble models like Random Forests and XGBoost based on this model.
